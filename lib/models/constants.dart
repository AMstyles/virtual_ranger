    "You should only travel in a vehicle that is well serviced and roadworthy.\n\nPrepare carefully - enquire from game rangers and management at the reserve about the roads and whether your vehicle will be capable of travelling on these roads.\n\nDo not \"test\" the capabilities of your vehicle and avoid driving where you cannot see the surface of the road.\n\n Remain on the paths at all times and do not leave them - you will not be aware of nasty surprises next to the roads.\n\nExpect roads to be narrow with few overtaking opportunities.\n\nBe alert to varying road conditions, changes in the road surface, sharp corners or crests which reduce visibility - adjust your speed accordingly.\nVisibility is often reduced by the presence of encroaching roadside vegetation and sharp corners. Patience needs to be demonstrated when sharing the road with other visitors and wildlife.\n\nSpeed needs to be reduced to the advised limits - remember this is a game drive - slow down and enjoy the view!\n\nDrivers need to be aware of the impact of the changing weather on the road surface and surrounding environment and drive accordingly by reducing speed and using lights appropriately. During winter, fog is a regular occurrence at dawn and dusk, which can obscure driver vision and require even slower speeds.\n\nOn a self-drive - stay in your vehicle at all times - you will put yourself in danger if you get out of your car anywhere unless at a designated safe place.\n\nRemember that even though you may have carefully scanned the area, animals are masters at remaining concealed - predators do it daily when stalking prey - do not risk becoming prey.\n\nIf you are close to an animal and observing it, take note of its behaviour - if it looks agitated in any way, makes mock runs at you, stares and paces up and down, then move slowly off.\n\nYou should be safe in your vehicle as vehicle/animal incidents are rare.\n\nRevving the engine or hooting is not a good idea as this might be a challenge - a contest where the odds are not on your side.";
